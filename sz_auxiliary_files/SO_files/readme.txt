first column of MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small_RMSTab.txt is skyfrac
second column is RMS noise (note there is only one angular scale, unlike plancks which has sigma(theta) in each skyfrac for 0<theta<30...)
Now accounting for different angular scales is done via the Q functions.


MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small_Qfit.txt has theta in first column and second column is Q value. To be interpolated at the required theta.
